# AICG_r1
This repo is the submission for an Computer Graphics assignement.

The website is deployed online via git hub pages.
It's an interface that allow to interact with a Ray Marching environement, allowing you to move square in this space and multiply them by row in the 3 axis.

It was my fisrt time working on Computer Graphics and Ray marching more specificaly, it's an interesting field that combine, maths and CS to create this 3D world.
I found it quite challenging to be inspired and create a creative experience with this newly discovered tool and techniques.

In conclusion it was a challenging and fun experience, I was able to create a functionning website even if it is a bit limited. I developped a better undesrtanding of the Ray Marching and what is possible with it.
ty for reading this far and I hope you will find my website a bit fun.
